# Orignal Work

I'd like to give credit where it is due. The source of this project is some great work by Nicola Asuni that proved super-easy to use. You can 
support that project @ http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=128076 or via PayPal at paypal@tecnick.com

# What this does

This port of Nicola's project focuses on 2 things

    * Generating fancy (rounded corner) QR codes
    * Generating PDF417 Barcodes
    * Providing a super-easy PHP mini-app that does these things (and more to come) within your application framework and outputs images that can be included in HTML img tags (see examples below)
